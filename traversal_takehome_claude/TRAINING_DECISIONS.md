# Training Decisions and Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines all training decisions, data processing choices, and hyperparameter selections made during the Qwen-7B fine-tuning project.

## Data Processing Decisions

### Dataset Selection
- **Primary Dataset**: 350K reasoning traces (placeholder: microsoft/orca-math-word-problems-200k)
- **Rationale**: Multi-domain reasoning traces improve model's step-by-step problem-solving capabilities
- **Backup Strategy**: Public mathematical reasoning datasets as fallback

### Data Cleaning Pipeline
1. **Length Filtering**
   - Minimum length: 50 characters per text field
   - Maximum length: 4096 characters per sample
   - Rationale: Remove trivial examples and prevent memory issues

2. **Deduplication**
   - Method: Hash-based duplicate detection
   - Threshold: Exact hash matches
   - Impact: Prevents overfitting on repeated examples

3. **Quality Filtering**
   - Remove samples with encoding issues
   - Filter incomplete solutions (containing "..." with <100 chars)
   - Standardize code block formatting

4. **Format Standardization**
   - Convert to instruction-following format: system/user/assistant
   - Ensure consistent conversation structure
   - Add appropriate special tokens

## Model Architecture Decisions

### Base Model Selection
- **Model**: Qwen-7B-Instruct
- **Rationale**: 
  - Strong instruction-following capabilities
  - Good performance on reasoning tasks
  - Reasonable size for fine-tuning with limited resources

### Fine-tuning Strategy
- **Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Memory efficient - allows fine-tuning 7B model on consumer hardware
  - Faster training than full fine-tuning
  - Preserves base model knowledge while adapting to new tasks

## Hyperparameter Choices

### LoRA Configuration
- **Rank (r)**: 16
- **Alpha**: 32 (2x rank, standard recommendation)
- **Dropout**: 0.1 (prevent overfitting)
- **Target Modules**: ["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"]
- **Rationale**: Focus on attention mechanisms for reasoning improvement

### Training Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-4
  - Higher than typical (1e-5) for faster adaptation
  - Still conservative to avoid catastrophic forgetting
- **Batch Size**: 4 per device, 4 gradient accumulation = effective batch size 16
  - Balanced for memory constraints and gradient stability
- **Epochs**: 3
  - Sufficient for adaptation without overfitting
- **Warmup Ratio**: 0.03 (3% of training steps)
  - Gradual learning rate increase for stable training
- **Weight Decay**: 0.01
  - Light regularization to prevent overfitting

### Optimization Strategy
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with paged optimization
- **Scheduler**: Cosine annealing
- **Mixed Precision**: FP16 for memory efficiency
- **Gradient Clipping**: Max norm 1.0 for stability

## Training Monitoring

### Primary Metrics
- **Training Loss**: Monitor convergence
- **Evaluation Loss**: Detect overfitting
- **Learning Rate**: Verify scheduler behavior
- **Training Speed**: Samples per second

### Evaluation Strategy
- **Split**: 95% train, 5% validation
- **Frequency**: Every 100 steps
- **Early Stopping**: 3 patience with min delta 0.001
- **Best Model Selection**: Lowest validation loss

## Prompting Strategy

### Format Design
```
<|im_start|>system
You are an expert competitive programmer. Solve the following problem with a complete Python solution.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{problem_description}

{examples}

Write a complete Python solution. Your code should read from standard input and write to standard output.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
{step_by_step_solution}
<|im_end|>
```

### Design Rationale
- **System Message**: Sets clear role and expectations
- **Examples**: Provides 1-3 input/output examples for context
- **Clear Instructions**: Specifies Python language and I/O requirements
- **Step-by-step**: Encourages reasoning trace in response

## Evaluation Methodology

### Benchmark Selection
- **Dataset**: DeepMind Code Contests
- **Split**: Test set for unbiased evaluation
- **Sample Size**: 100 problems for initial evaluation (scalable)

### Metrics
1. **Generation Rate**: Percentage of problems with valid code generation
2. **Code Quality**: Syntactic correctness (Python parsing)
3. **Difficulty Analysis**: Performance breakdown by problem difficulty
4. **Improvement Measurement**: Before/after fine-tuning comparison

### Comparison Strategy
- Same random seed for reproducibility
- Identical prompting format for fair comparison
- Same problem subset for baseline and fine-tuned evaluation

## Hardware Considerations

### Memory Management
- **Model Loading**: 16-bit precision to fit 7B model
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce memory at cost of speed
- **Device Mapping**: Automatic GPU/CPU distribution

### Training Efficiency
- **DataLoader Workers**: 4 parallel workers for data loading
- **Pin Memory**: Speed up CPU-GPU transfers
- **Compilation**: Use torch.compile where possible

## Risk Mitigation

### Overfitting Prevention
- Early stopping with validation monitoring
- Weight decay regularization
- LoRA dropout
- Limited epochs (3)

### Training Stability
- Gradient clipping
- Learning rate warmup
- Mixed precision with automatic scaling
- Regular checkpointing every 500 steps

### Reproducibility
- Fixed random seeds (42)
- Deterministic algorithms where possible
- Version pinning in requirements.txt
- Configuration logging

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Criteria
- **Generation Rate**: >80% on evaluation set
- **Improvement**: >10% relative improvement over baseline
- **Training Stability**: Loss convergence without major spikes
- **Code Quality**: Syntactically correct Python output

### Potential Issues and Mitigations
1. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size, increase gradient accumulation
2. **Slow Convergence**: Increase learning rate slightly
3. **Overfitting**: Add more regularization, reduce epochs
4. **Poor Code Generation**: Adjust prompting format, add more code examples

## Post-Training Analysis

### Model Evaluation
- Quantitative metrics on held-out test set
- Qualitative analysis of generated solutions
- Error analysis for failure cases
- Performance comparison across difficulty levels

### Deployment Considerations
- Model size and inference speed
- Memory requirements for serving
- API design for practical usage
- Scaling considerations for production use
